“ There let the way appear Steps up to heaven.”
So it was with Jacob, when, oppressed with the fear that his sin had cut him off from God, he lay down to rest, and “he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven.” The connection between earth and heaven was thus revealed to him, and words of comfort and hope were spoken to the wanderer by Him who stood at the top of the shadowy stairs. May the heavenly vision be repeated to many as they read this story of the way of life. Publishers.

 God’s Love For Man
NATUREandrevelationaliketestifyofGod’slove. Our Father in heaven is the source of life, of wisdom, and of joy. Look at the wonderful and beau¬ tiful things of nature. Think of their marvelous adap¬ tation to the needs and happiness, not only of man,
but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator’s love. It is God who supplies the daily needs of all His crea¬ tures. In the beautiful words of the Psalmist,—
“The eyes of all wait upon Thee;
And Thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest Thine hand, Andsatisfiestthedesireofeverylivingthing.”1
God made man perfectly holy and happy; and the fair earth, as it came from the Creator’s hand,
bore no blight of decay or shadow of the
curse. It is transgression of God’s law — the law of love — that has brought woe and death. Yet even amid the suffer¬
ing that results from sin, God’s love
is revealed. It is written that God cursed the ground for man’s sake.2 The thorn and the thistle — the difficulties and trials that make his

for his uplifting from the ruin and degrada¬ tion that sin has wrought. The w
though fallen,, is not all sorrow and
misery. In nature itself are mes¬
sages of hope and comfort. There are flowers upon the thistles, and the thorns are covered with roses.
“God is love,” is written upon
every opening bud, upon every spire of springing grass. The lovely birds making the air vocal with their happy songs, the delicately tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air, the lofty trees of the forest with their rich foliage of living
green,— all testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God, and to His desire to make His children

revealing to the world the infinite love of God, that Jesus came to live among men.
The Son of God came from heaven to make mani¬ fest the Father. “No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom

of the Father, He hath declared Him.” 1 “ Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he towhomsoevertheSonwillrevealHim.”2 When one of the disciples made the request, “Show us the Father,” Jesus answered, “ Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? '” 3
In describing His earthly mission, Jesus' said, The Lord “hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.” 4 This was His work. He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by

Satan. There were whole villages where there was not a moan of sickness in any house; for He had
passed through them, and healed all their sick. His work gave evidence of Flis divine anointing. Love,
mercy, and compassion were re¬ vealed in every act of His life; His heart went out in tender sympathy to the children of
men. Pie took man’s na¬ ture, that He might reach man’s wants. The poorest and humblest were not

afraid to approach Him. Even little children were attracted to Him. They loved to climb upon His knees, and gaze into the pensive face, benignant with love.
Jesus did not suppress one word of truth, but He uttered it always in love. He exercised the
greatest tact, and thoughtful, kind attention,
in His intercourse with the people. He
was never rude, never needlessly spoke
a severe word, never gave needless pain toasensitivesoul.Hedidnotcensure human weakness. He spoke the truth,
but always in love. He denounced hypoc¬ risy, unbelief, and iniquity; but tears were in His voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. He wept over Jerusalem, the

Him, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

Such is the character of Christ as revealed in His life. This is the character of God. It is from the Father’s heart that the streams of divine compassion,

manifest in Christ, flow out to the children of men. Jesus, the tender, pitying Saviour, was God “ mani¬ fest in the flesh.” 1
It was to redeem us that Jesus lived and suffered and died. He became a “ Man of sorrows,”
that we might be made par¬ takers of everlasting joy; God permitted His beloved Son, full of grace and truth, to
come from a world of in¬
describable glory, to a world marred and blighted with sin, darkened with the shadow of death and the curse,
le permitted Him to leave the bosom of His love, the adora¬ tion of the angels, to suffer shame, insult, humiliation, hatred, and death. , “ The chastisement of our peace

was upon Him ; and with His stripes we are healed.” 2 Behold Him in the wilderness, in Gethsemane, upon the cross! The spotless Son of God took upon Him¬ self the burden of sin. He who had been one with God, felt in His soul the awful separation that sin makes between God and man. This wrung from His lips the anguished cry, “ My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? ” 3 It was the burden of sin,

the sense of its terrible enormity, of its separation of the soul from God,— it was this that broke the heart of the Son of God.
But this great sacrifice was not made in order to create in the Father’s heart a love for man, not to make Him willing to save. No, no! “ God so loved
the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.” 1 The Father loves us, not because of the great propi¬ tiation, but He provided the propitiation because He loves us. Christ was the medium through which He could pour out His infinite love upon a fallen world. “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.”2 God suffered with His Son. In the agony of Gethsemane, the death of Calvary, the heart of Infinite Love paid the price of our redemption.
Jesus said, “ Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it * again.” 3 That is, “ My Father hath so loved you that He even loves Me more for giving My life to
redeem you. In becoming your Substitute and Surety, by surrendering My life, by taking your liabilities, your transgres¬
sions, I am endeared to My Father; for by My Sacrifice,

God can be just, and yet the Justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.”
None but the Son of God could accomplish our redemption; for only He who was in the bosom of the Father could declare Him. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it manifest. Nothing less than the infinite sacrifice made by Christ in behalf of fallen man could express the Father’s love to lost humanity.
“God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.” He gave Him not
only to live among men, to bear
their sins, and die their sacrifice,
He gave Him to the fallen race. Christ was to identify Plimself with the interests and needs of human¬ ity. He who was one with God has linked Himself with the chil¬ dren of men by ties that are never to be broken. Jesus is “not ashamed to call them brethren ;” 1 He is
our Sacrifice, our Advocate, our Brother, bearing our hu- man form before the Father’s throne, and
through eternal ages one with the race He has re¬ deemed,— the Son of man. And all this that man might be uplifted from the ruin and

most profound meditation! The matchless love of God for a world that did not love Him! The thought has a subduing power upon the soul, and brings the mind into captivity to the will of God. The more we study the divine character in the light of the cross, the more we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness
blended with equity and justice, and the more clearly we discern innumerable evidences of a love that is infinite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother’s yearn¬ ing sympathy for her wayward child.
" Every human tie may perish,

But no change

 The Sinner’s Need of Christ
MAN was originally endowed with noble powers and a well-balanced mind. He was perfect in his being, and in harmony with God. His thoughts were pure, his aims holy. But through disobedience, his powers were perverted, and selfishness took the place of love. His nature became so weakened through transgression that it was impossible for him, in his own strength, to resist the power of evil. He was made captive by Satan, and would have remained so
forever had not God specially interposed. It was the tempter’s purpose to thwart the divine plan in man’s creation, and fill the earth with woe and desolation. And he would point to all this evil as the result of God’s work in creating man.
In his sinless state, man held joyful communion with Him “ in whom are hid all the treasures of wis¬ dom and knowledge.” 1 But after his sin, he could no longer find joy in holiness, and he sought to hide from the presence of God. Such is still the condition of the unrenewed heart. It is not in harmony with God, and finds no joy in communion with Him. The sinner could not be happy in God’s presence; he would shrink from the companionship of holy beings. Could he be permitted to enter heaven, it would have no joy for him. The spirit of unselfish love that reigns there — every heart responding to the heart of Infinite Love
1Col- 2: 3.

 20 STEPS TO CHRIST
— would touch no answering chord in his soul. His ,thoughts, his interests, his motives, would be alien to those that actuate the sinless dwellers there. He would be a discordant note in the melody of heaven. Heaven would be to him a place of torture; he would long to be hidden from Him who is its light, and the center of its joy. It is no arbitrary decree on the part of God that excludes the wicked from heaven: they are shut out by their own unfitness for its compan¬
ionship. The glory of God would be to them a con¬ suming fire. They would welcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who died
to redeem them.
It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from
the pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts areevil,andwecannotchangethem.“Whocan bringacleanthingoutofanunclean?—Notone.” “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” 1 Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they can not change the heart; they
can not purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness. The Saviour said, “Except a man be born from above,” unless he shall receive a new heart, 1Job 14:4; Rom. 8:7.
t

 THE SINNER’S NEED OF CHRIST 21
new desires, purposes, and motives, leading to a new life, “ he can not see the kingdom of God.’' 1 The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good that exists in man by nature, is a fatal deception. “ The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.” 2 Of Christ it is written, “ In Him was life; and the life was the light of men,” the only “name
under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” 3
It is not enough to perceive the lov¬ ing-kindness of God, to see the benev¬ olence, the fatherly tenderness, of His character. It is not enough to discern the wisdom and justice of His
law, to see that it is founded upon the eternal principle of love. Paul the apostle
saw all this when he ex¬ claimed, “ I consent unto
the law that it is good.” “ The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” But he added, in the bitterness of his soul-anguish and de¬ spair, “ I am carnal, sold under sin.” 4 He longed

that his sin had cut him ofif from God, that he was forsaken of Heaven. In sadness he lay down to rest on the bare earth,
around him only the lonely hills, and above, the heavens bright with stars. As he slept, a strange light broke upon his vision; and lo,from the plain on which he lay,
vast shadowy stairs seemed to lead upward to the very gates of heaven, and upon them angels of God were passing up and down; while from the glory above, the divine voice was heard in

for the purity, the righteousness, to which in himself he was powerless to attain, and he cried out, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death? ” 1 Such is the cry that has gone up from burdened hearts in all lands and in all ages. To all, there is but one answer, “ Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” 2
Many are the figures by which the Spirit of God has sought to illustrate this truth, and make it plain to souls that long to be freed from the burden of guilt. When, after his sin in deceiving Esau, Jacob fled from his father’s home, he was weighed down with a sense of guilt. Lonely and outcast as he was, separated from all that had made life dear, the one thought that above all others pressed upon his soul, was the fear
’Rom. 7:24 (margin). 2John 1:29.

 THE SINNER’S NEED OF CHRIST 23
a message of comfort and hope. Thus was made known to Jacob that which met the need and longing ofhissoul,—aSaviour.Withjoyandgratitude he saw revealed a way by which he, a sinner, could be restored to communion with God. The mystic ladder
of his dream represented Jesus, the only medium of communication be¬ tween God and man.
This is the same figure to which Christ referred in His conversa¬ tion with Nathanael, when He said,“Yeshallseeheavenopen, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” 1 In the apostasy, man alienatedhimselffromGod;earth was cut off from heaven. Across the gulf that lay between, there could be no communion. But through Christ, earth is again
linkedwithheaven.WithHisownmerits,Christhas bridged the gulf which sin had made, so that the min¬ istering angels can hold communion with man. Christ connects fallen man, in his weakness and helplessness with the Source of infinite power.
But in vain are men’s dreams of progress, in vain all efforts for the uplifting of humanity, if they neg¬ lect the one source of hope and help for the fallen race. “ Everv good gift and every perfect gift ” 2 is from God. There is no true excellence of character
1John 1:51. 2James 1:17.

 24
STEPS TO CHRIST
apart from Him. And the only way to God is Christ. He says, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. ” 1
The heart of God yearns over His earthly children with a love stronger than death. In giving up His Son, He has poured out to us all heaven in one gift. The Saviour’s life and death and intercession, the ministry of angels, the pleading of the Spirit, the Father working above and through all, the unceasing interest of heavenly beings,—•all are enlisted in behalf of man’s redemption.
O let us contemplate the amazing sacrifice that has been made for us! Let us try to appreciate the labor and energy that Heaven is expending to reclaim the lost, and bring them back to the Father’s house.
Motives stronger, and agencies more powerful, could never be brought into operation ; the exceeding rewards for right-doing, the enjoyment of heaven, the society of the angels, the communion and love of God and His Son, the elevation and extension of all our powers throughout eternal ages,— are these not mighty incen¬ tives and encouragements to urge us to give the heart’s loving service to our Creator and Redeemer?
And, on the other hand, the judgments of God pronounced against sin, the inevitable retribution, the degradation of our character, and the final destruction, are presented in God’s Word to warn us against the service of Satan.
Shall we not regard the mercy of God? What
more could He do? Let us place ourselves in right 1John 14: 6.

 THE SINNER’S NEED OF CHRIST 25
relation to Him who has loved us with amazing love. Let us avail ourselves of the means provided for 11s that we may be transformed into His likeness, and be restored to fellowship with the ministering angels, to harmony and communion with the Father and the Son.
“ 1am the Way, the ^ fruth, and the Life.”

 Repentance
HO W shall a man be just with God? How shall the sinner be made righteous ? It is only through Christ that we can be brought into harmony with God, with holiness; but how are we to come to Christ? Many are asking the same question as did the multi¬ tude on the day of Pentecost, when, convicted of sin, theycriedout,“Whatshallwedo?,”Thefirstword of Peter’s answer was, “ Repent.” 1 At another time,
shortly after, he said, “ Repent, . . . and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.” 2
Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness ; until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the life.
There are many who fail to understand the true nature of repentance. Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned, and even make an outward reformation, because they fear that their wrong-doing will bring suffering upon themselves. Put this is not repentance in the Bible sense. They lament the suffering,

sword, acknowledged his guilt lest he should lose his life; but there was no genuine repentance for sin, no conversion of purpose, no abhorrence of evil. Judas Iscariot, after betraying his Lord, ex¬
claimed, “ I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.” 1
The confession was forced from his guilty soul by an awful sense of con¬ demnation and a fearful looking for of
heart-breaking grief in his soul, that he had betrayed the spotless Son of God, and denied the Holy One of Israel. Pharaoh, when suffering under the judgments of God, acknowledged his sin, in order to escape further punishment, but returned to his
defiance of Heaven as soon as the plagues were stayed. These all lamented the results of sin, but did not sorrow for the sin itself.
But when the heart yields to the influence of the Spirit of God, the conscience will be quick¬ ened, and the sinner will discern something of the depth and sacredness of God’s holy law, the foun-

hidden things of made manifest, hold upon the The sinner has righteousness of feels the terror
to be restored to communion with Heaven.
The prayer of David after his fall, illustrates the nature of true sorrow for sin. His repentance was sincere and deep. There was no effort to palliate his guilt; no desire to escape the judgment threatened, inspired his prayer. David saw the enormity of his transgression; he saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his sin. It was not for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of heart. He longed for the joy of holiness,— to be restored to harmony and com¬ munion with God. This was the language of his
soul:2 —
“ Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,
And in whose spirit there is no guile.”’

A repentance such as this, is beyond the reach of our own power to accomplish; it is obtained only from Christ, who ascended up on high, and has given gifts unto men.

and contrite heart that will feel the need of a Sa¬ viour. But must the sinner wait till he has repented before he can come to Jesus? Is repentance to be made an obstacle between the sinner and the Saviour?
The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent before he can heed the invitation of Christ, “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” 1 It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ, that leads to genuine repent¬ ance. Peter made the matter clear in his statement to the Israelites, when he said, “Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.”2WecannomorerepentwithouttheSpirit of Christ to awaken the conscience than we can be

Christ is the source of every right impulse. He
is the only one that can implant in the heart enmity against sin. Every desire for truth and purity, every conviction of our own sinfulness, is an evidence that His Spirit is moving upon our hearts.
Jesus has said, “ I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.” 3 Christ must be re¬ vealed to the sinner as the Saviour dying for the sins of the world; and as we behold the Lamb of God upon the cross of Calvary, the mystery of redemption begins to unfold to our minds, and the goodness of God leads us to repentance. In dying for sinners Christ manifested a love that is incomprehensible and as the sinner beholds this love, it softens the heart

impresses the mind, and inspires contrition in the soul. It is true that men sometimes become ashamed of their sinful ways, and give up some of their evil
habits, before they are conscious that they are being drawn to Christ. But whenever they make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to do right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them. An influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul, and the conscience is quickened, and the outward life is amended. And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross, to behold Him whom their sins have pierced, the commandment comes home to the conscience. The wickedness of their life, the deep-seated sin of the soul, is revealed to them. They begin to comprehend something of the righteousness of Christ, and exclaim, “Whatissin,thatitshouldrequiresuchasacrifice

the hearts of men, and creating an inexpressible cra¬ ving for something they have not. The things of the world can not satisfy their longing. The Spirit of God is pleading with them to seek for those things that alone can give peace and rest,— the grace of Christ, the joy of holiness. Through influences seen and unseen, our Saviour is constantly at work to at¬
tract the minds of men from the unsatisfying
pleasures of sin to the infinite blessings that i

recognize this longing as the voice of God to your soul. Ask Him to give you repentance, to reveal Christ to you in His infinite love, vin His perfect purity. In the Saviour’s life the principles of God’s law — love to God and man — were perfectly exemplified. Benevolence, unselfish love, was

the heart before God, like the common sinner: but when the light from Christ shines into our souls, we shall see how impure we are; we shall discern the selfishness of motive, the enmity against God, that has defiled every act of life. Then we shall know that our own righteousness is indeed as filthy rags, and that the blood of Christ alone can cleanse us from the defilement of sin, and renew our hearts in His own likeness.
One ray of the glory of God, one gleam of the purity of Christ, penetrating the soul, makes every spot of defilement painfully distinct, and lays bare the deformity and defects of the human character. It makes apparent the unhallowed desires, the infidelity of the heart, the impurity of the lips. The sinner’s acts of disloyalty in making void the law of God, are exposed to his sight, and his spirit is stricken and afflicted under the searching influence of the Spirit of
God; He loathes himself as he views less character of Christ.
When the prophet Daniel beheld the glory surrounding the heavenly messenger that was sent unto him, he
was overwhelmed with a sense of his own weakness and imperfection. De¬ scribing the effect of the wonderful scene, he says, “There remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.” 1 The soul thus

Man’s judgment is partial, imperfect; but God estimates all things as they really are. The drunk¬ ard is despised, and is told that his sin will exclude him from heaven; while pride, selfishness, and covetousness too often go unrebuked. But these are sins

touched will hate its selfishness, abhor its self-love, and will seek, through Christ’s righteousness, for the purity of heart that is in harmony with the law of God and the character of Christ.
Paul says that as “ touching the righteousness which is in the law,”— as far as outward acts were concerned,— he was “ blameless ; ” 1 but when the spiritual character of the law was discerned, he saw himself a sinner. Judged by the letter of the law as men apply it to the outward life, he had abstained from sin; but when he looked into the depths of its holy precepts, and saw himself as God saw him, he bowed in humiliation, and confessed his guilt. He
says, “ I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.”2 When he saw the spiritual nature of the law, sin appeared in its true hideousness, and his self-esteem was gone.

that are especially offensive to God; for they are contrary to the benevolence of His character, to that unselfish love which is the very atmosphere of the unfallen universe. He who falls into some of the grosser sins may feel a sense of his shame and. pov¬ erty and his need of the grace of Christ; but pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart against Christ, and the infinite blessings He came to give.

came before God, asking for His mercy. His heart was open for the Spirit of God to do its gracious work, and set him free from the power of sin. The Pharisee’s boastful, self-righteous prayer showed that his heart was closed against the influence of the Holy Spirit. Be¬ cause of his distance from God, he had no sense of his own defilement, in contrast
with the perfection of the divine holiness. He felt no need, and he received nothing.

The exceeding sin¬ fulnessofsincanbeestimatedonlyinthelight.ofthe cross. When men urge that God is too good to cast off the sinner, let them look to Calvary. It was because there was no other way in which man could be saved, because without this sacrifice it was impossible for the human race to escape from the defiling power of sin, and be restored to communion with holy beings,— impossible for them again to become partakers of spir¬ itual life,— it was because of this that Christ took upon Himself the guilt of the disobedient, and suffered in the sinner’s stead. The love and suffering and death of the Son of God, all testify to the terrible enormity of sin, and declare that there is no escape from its power, no hope of the higher life, but through the submission of the soul to Christ.
The impenitent sometimes excuse themselves by saying of professed Christians, “ I am as good as they are. They are no more self-denying, sober, or circum¬ spect in their conduct than I am. They love pleasure and self-indulgence as well as I do.” Thus they make the faults of others an excuse for their own neglect of duty.

So small a matter as eating of the forbidden fruit

Here is where thousands upon thousands have erred, to their eternal loss. I will not here dwell upon the shortness and uncertainty of life; but there is a ter¬ rible danger — a danger not sufficiently understood — in delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God's Holy Spirit, in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay really is. Sin, however small it may be esteemed, can be indulged in only at the peril of infinite loss. What we do not overcome, will overcome us, and work out our destruction.
Adam and Eve persuaded themselves that in so small a matter as eating of the forbidden fruit, there could not result such terrible consequences as God had declared. But this small matter was the trans¬ gression of God’s immutable and holy law, and it

separated man from God, and opened the flood-gates of death and untold woe upon our world. Age after age there has gone up from our earth a continual cry of mourning, and the whole creation groaneth and travaileth together in pain, as a consequence of man’s disobedience. Heaven itself has felt the effects of his rebellion against God. Calvary stands as a memorial of the amazing sacrifice required to atone for the transgression of the divine law. Let us' not regard sin as a trivial thing.
Every act of transgression, every neglect or rejec¬ tion of the grace of Christ, is reacting upon yourself; it is hardening the heart, depraving the will, benumb¬ ing the understanding, and not only making you less inclined to yield, but less capable of yielding, to the tender pleading of God's Holy Spirit.
Many are quieting a troubled conscience with the thought that they can change a course of evil when they choose; that they can trifle with the invita¬ tions of mercy, and yet be again and again impressed. They think that after doing despite to the Spirit of grace, after casting their influence on the side of Satan, in a moment of terrible extremity they can change their course. But this is not so easily done. The experience, the education, of a lifetime, has so thoroughly molded the character that few then desire to receive the image of Jesus.
Even one wrong trait of character, one sinful desire, persistently cherished, will eventually neutralize all the power of the gospel. Every sinful indulgence

strengthens the soul’s aversion to God. The man who manifests an infidel hardihood, or a stolid indifference to divine truth, is but reaping the harvest of that which he has himself sown. In all the Bible there is not a more fearful warning against trifling with evil than the words of the wise man, that the sinner “shall be holden with the cords of his sins/ ’1
Christ is ready to set us free from sin, but He does not force the will; and if by persistent trans¬ gression the will itself is wholly bent on evil, and we do not desire to be set free, if we will not accept His grace, what more can He do? We have destroyed ourselves by our determined rejection of His love. “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is
the day of salvation/’ “To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.” 2
“Manlookethontheoutwardappearance,butthe Lord looketh on the heart,” 3 the human heart, with its conflicting emotions of joy and sorrow, the wan¬ dering, wayward heart, which is the abode of so much impurity and deceit.

Like the Psalmist, throw its chambers opentotheall-seeingeye,exclaiming,“Searchme,O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.” 4

Acknowledge your sin, but tell the enemy that “ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,” 1 and that you may be saved by His matchless love. Jesus asked Simon a question in regard to two debtors. One owed his lord a small sum, and the other owed him a very large sum; but he forgave them both, and Christ asked Simon which debtor would love his lord most. Simon answered, “He to whom he forgave most.”2 Wehavebeengreatsinners,butChristdied that we might be forgiven. The merits of His sac¬

Those to whom He has forgiven most will love Him most, and will stand nearest His throne to praise Him for His great love and infinite sacrifice. It is when we most fully comprehend the love of God that we best realize the sinfulness of sin. When we see the length of the chain that was let down for us, when we understand something of the infinite sacrifice that Christ has made in our behalf, the heart is melted
with tenderness and contrition.

souls before God in acknowledging their guilt, have not yet fulfilled the first condition of acceptance. If we have not experienced that repentance which is not to be repented of, and have not with true humiliation of soul and brokenness of spirit confessed our sins, abhorring our iniquity, we have never truly sought for the forgiveness of sin; and if we have never sought, we have never found the peace of God. The only reason why we do not have remission of sins that are past is that we are not willing to humble our hearts and comply with the conditions of the word of truth. Explicit instruction is given concerning this matter. Confession of sin, whether public or private, should be heartfelt, and freely expressed. It is not to be urged from the sinner. It is not to be made in a flippant and careless way, or forced from those who have no real¬ izing sense of the abhorrent character of sin. The con¬ fession that is the outpouring of the inmost soul finds its way to the God of infinite pity. The Psalmist says, “The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.”1
True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges particular sins. They may
be of.such a nature as to be brought before
God only; they may be wrongs that
should be confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through them;
or they may be of a public character,

STEPS TO CHRIST
In the days of Samuel, the Israelites wandered from God. They were suffering the consequences of sin; for they had lost their faith in God, lost their discernment of His power and wisdom to rule the nation, lost their confidence in His ability to defend and vindicate His cause. They turned from the great Ruler of the universe, and desired to be governed as were the nations around them. Before they found peace,theymadethisdefiniteconfession:“Wehave added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.” 1 The very sin of which they were convicted had to be confessed. Their ingratitude oppressed their souls, and severed them from God.
Confession will not be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and reformation. There must be decided changes in the life; everything offensive to God must be put away. This will be the result of genuine sorrow for sin. The work that we have to doonourpartisplainlysetbeforeus:“Washyou, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.” 2 “ If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.” 3 Paul says, speakingoftheworkofrepentance:“Yesorrowed

When sin has deadened the moral perceptions, the

45
wrong-doer does not discern the defects of his char¬ acter, nor realize the enormity of the evil he has committed; and unless he yields to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, he remains in partial blind¬ ness to his sin. His confessions are not sincere and in earnest. To every acknowledgment of his guilt he adds an apology in excuse of his course, declaring that if it had not been for certain circumstances, he would not have done this or that, for which he is reproved.
After Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, they were filled with a sense of shame and terror. At first their only thought was how to excuse their sin, and escape the dreaded sentence of death. When the Lord inquired concerning their sin, Adam replied, laying the guilt partly upon God and partly upon his companion: “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat." The woman put the blame upon the serpent, saying, “ The serpentbeguiledme,andIdideat.”1 WhydidYou make the serpent? Why did You suffer him to come into Eden? These were the questions implied in her excuse for her sin, thus charging God with the respon¬ sibility of their fall. The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies, and has been exhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam. Confessions of this order are not inspired by the divine Spirit, and will not be acceptable to God. True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself, and acknowledge it without deception or hypocrisy. Like the poor pub¬ lican, not lifting up so much as his eyes unto heaven, hewillcry,“Godbemercifultomeasinner;”and those who do acknowledge their guilt will be justified;
1Gen. 3: 12, 13.

 46 STEPS TO CHRIST
for Jesus will plead His blood in behalf of the repent¬ ant soul.
The examples in God’s Word of genuine repent¬ ance and humiliation reveal a spirit of confession in which there is no excuse for sin, or attempt at self¬ justification. Paul did not seek to shield himself; he paints his sin in its darkest hue, not attempting to lessen his guilt. He says: “ Many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. Arid I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blas¬ pheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.” 1 He does not hesitate to declare that “ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” 2
The humble and broken heart, subdued by genu¬ ine repentance, will appreciate something of the love of God and the cost of Calvary; and as a son confesses to a loving father, so will the truly penitent bring all his sins before God. And it is written, “ If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” 3

 Consecration
GOD’S promise is, “Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.” 1
The whole heart must be yielded to God, or the change can never be wrought in us by which we are to be restored to His likeness. By nature we are alienated from God. The Holy Spirit describes our condition in such words as these: “Dead in tres¬ passes and sins; ” “ the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;” “no soundness in it.” We are held fast in the snare of Satan; “taken captive by him at his will.” 2 God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transforma¬ tion, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him.
The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a struggle; but
the soul must submit to God ^ before it can be renewed in holiness.

blind submission, an unreasoning control. It appeals to the intellect and the conscience. “ Come now, and let us reason together,” 1 is the Creator’s invitation to the beings He has made. God does not force the will of His creatures. He can not accept an homage that is not willingly and intelligently given. A mere forced submission would prevent all real develop¬ ment of mind or character; it would make man a mere automaton. Such is not the purpose of the Creator. He desires that man, the crowning work of His creative power, shall reach the highest possible development. He sets before us the height of bless¬ ing to which He desires to bring us through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to Him, that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to
choose whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share the glorious liberty of the sons of God.
In giving ourselves to God, we must necessarily give up all that would separate us from Him. Hence theSavioursays,“Whosoeverhebeofyouthatfor- saketh not all that he hath, he can not be My dis¬

There are those who profess to serve God, while they rely upon their own efforts to obey His law, to form a right character, and secure salvation. Their hearts are not moved by any deep sense of the love of Christ, but they seek to perform the duties of the Christian life as that which God requires of them in order to gainheaven.Suchreligionisworthnothing.When Christ dwells in the heart, the soul will be so filled with His love, with the joy of communion with Him, that it will cleave to Him; and in the contemplation of Him, self will be forgotten. Love to Christ will be the spring of action. Those who feel the constrain¬ ing love of God, do not ask how little may be given to meet the requirements of God; they do not ask for the lowest standard, but aim at perfect conformity
to the will of their Redeemer. With earnest desire they yield all, and manifest an interest proportionate to the value of the object which they seek. A profes¬ sion of Christ without this deep love, is mere talk, dry formality, and heavy drudgery.

No real joy can be found in the path forbidden by Him who knows what is best, and who plans for the good of His creatures. The path of transgression is the path of misery and destruction.
It is a mistake to entertain the thought that God is pleased to see His children suffer. All Heaven is interested in the happiness of man. Our heavenly Father does not close the avenues of joy to any of His creatures.

ropes of sand. You can not control your thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of your broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens your confidence in your own sincerity, and causes you to feel that God can not accept you; but you need not despair. What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You can not change your heart, you can not of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be in harmony with Him.
Desires for goodness and holiness are right as far as they go; but if you stop here, they will avail nothing.Manywillbelostwhilehopinganddesiring to be Christians. They do not come to the point of yielding the will to God. They do not now choose to be Christians.
Through the right exercise of the will, an entire change may be made in your life. By yielding up your will to Christ, you ally yourself with the power that is above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from above to hold you steadfast, and thus through constant surrender to God you will be enabled to live the new life, even the life of faith.

 Faith And Acceptance
AS your conscience has been quickened by the Holy Spirit, you have seen something of the evil of sin, of its power, its guilt, its woe; and you look upon
it with abhorrence. You feel that sin has separated you from God, that you are in bondage to the power of evil. The more you struggle to escape, the more you realize your helplessness. Your motives are impure; your heart is unclean. You see that your life has been filledwithselfishnessandsin. Youlongtobeforgiven, to be cleansed, to be set free. Harmony with God, likeness to Him,— what can vou do to obtain it?
It is peace that you need,— Heaven’s forgiveness and peace and love in the soul. Money can not buy it, intellect can not procure it, wisdom can not attain to it; you can never hope, by your own effort, to secure it. But God offers it to you as a gift, “ without money and without price.” 1 It is yours, if you will but reach out your hand and grasp it. The Lord says, “ Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” 2 “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.” 3
You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away. You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins, and give you a new heart. Then believe that He does this because He has promised.

This is the lesson which Jesus taught while He was on earth, that the gift which God promises us, we must believe we do receive, and it is ours. Jesus healed the people of their diseases when they had faith in His power; He helped them in the things which they could see, thus inspiring them with confi¬ dence in Him concerning things which they could not see,— leading them to believe in His power to forgive sins. This He plainly stated in the healing of the man sick with palsy: “That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (then saith He to the sick of the palsy), Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.” 1 So also John the evangelist says, speaking of the miracles of Christ, “These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name.” 2
From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed the sick, we may learn something about how to believe in Him for the forgiveness of sins. Let us turn to the story of the paralytic at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had not used his limbs forthirty-eightyears.YetJesusbadehim,“Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.” The sick man might have said, “ Lord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.” But no, he believed Christ’s word, believed that he was made whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk, and he did walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He was made whole.
1Matt. 9:6. 2John 20:31.

In like manner you are a sinner. You can not atone for your past sins, you can not change your heart, and make yourself holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ. You believe that promise. You confess your sins, and give yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfil His word to you. If you believe the promise,— believe that you are forgiven and cleansed,— God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It is so if you believe it.
Do not wait to feel thr are made whole, but say, “ . believe it; it is so, not be
cause I feel it, but because God has promised.”
Jesus says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ve shall have them.” 1 There is a condition to thispromise,—thatwepray according to the will of God. But it is the will
of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a

holy life. So we may ask for these blessings, and believe that we receive them, and thank God that we have received them. It is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame or remorse. “ There is therefore now no con¬ demnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” 1
Henceforth you are not your own; you are bought with a price. “ Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, . . . but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.” 2 Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has be¬ gotten a new life in your heart. You are as a child born into the family of God, and He loves you as He loves
His Son.
Now that you have given yourself

to Jesus, do not draw back, do not take yourself away from Him, but day by day say, ‘I am Christ’s; I have given myself to Him;” and ask Him to give you His Spirit, and keep you by His grace. As it is by giving yourself to God, and believing Him, that you become His child, so you are to live in Him. The apostle says, “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
walk ye in Him.” 3
Some seem to feel that they must be on probation,
and must prove to the Lord that they are reformed,
before they can claim His blessing. But they may

claim the blessing1 of God even now. They must have His grace, the Spirit of Christ, to help their infirmi¬ ties, or they can not resist evil. Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as we are, sinful, helpless, depend¬ ent. We may come with all our weakness, our folly, our sinfulness, and fall at His feet in penitence. It is His glory to encircle us in the arms of His love, and to bind up our wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity.
Here is where thousands fail: they do not believe that Jesus pardons them personally, individually. They do not take God at His word. It is the privi¬ lege of all who comply with the conditions to know for themselves that pardon is freely extended for every sin. Put away the suspicion that God’s promises are not meant for you. They are for every
repentant transgressor. Strength
and grace have been provided
through Christ to be brought by
ministering angels to every be¬
lieving soul. None are so sinful
that they can not find strength,
purity, and righteousness in
Jesus, who died for them. He

not that I should perish. I have a compasr sionate heavenly Father; and although I have abused His love, though the blessings He has given me have been squandered, I will arise, and go to my

parable tells you how the wanderer will be received: “ When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.” 1
But even this parable, tender and touching as it is, comes short of expressing the infinite compassion of the heavenly Father. The Lord declares by His prophet, “ I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee ” 2 While the sinner is yet far from the Father’s house, wasting his substance in a strange country, the Father’s heart is yearning over him; and every long¬ ing awakened in the soul to return to God, is but the tender pleading of His Spirit, wooing, entreating, drawing the wanderer to his Father’s heart of love.
With the rich promises of the Bible before you, can you give place to doubt? Can you believe that when the poor sinner longs to return, longs to forsake his sins, the Lord sternly withholds him from coming to His feet in repentance? Away with such thoughts!
Nothing can hurt your own soul more than to entertain such a con¬ ception of our heavenly Father. He hates sin, but He loves the sinner, and He gave Himself in the person of Christ, that all who would, might be saved, and have eternal blessedness in the kingdom ofglory.Whatstrongerormore tender language could have been

employed than He has chosen in which to express His love toward us ? He declares, “ Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compas¬ sion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.” 1
Look up, you that are doubting and trembling; for Jesus lives to make intercession for us. Thank God for the gift of His dear Son, and pray that He may not have died for you in vain. The Spirit invites you to-day. Come with your whole heart to Jesus, and you may claim His blessing.
As you read the promises, remember they are the expression of unutterable love and pity.

 The Test of Discipleship
IF any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new/ ’1
A person may not be able to tell the exact time or place, or to trace all the chain of circumstances in the process of conversion; but this does not prove him to be unconverted. Christ said to Nicodemus, “ The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
yn >? • ,
and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” 2 Like the wind,
which is invisible, yet the effects of which are plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon
human heart. That regenera- power, which no human eye can see, begets a new life in
the soul; it creates a new being in the image of God. While the work of the Spirit is silent and imper¬ ceptible, its effects are manifest. If the heart has been renewed bv the

Spirit of God, the life will bear witness to the fact. While we can not do anything to change our hearts, or to bring ourselves into harmony with God; while we must not trust at all to ourselves or our good works, our lives will reveal whether the grace of God is dwelling within us« A change will be seen in the character, the habits, the pursuits. The contrast will be clear and decided between what they have been and what they are. The character is revealed, not by occasional good deeds and occasional misdeeds, but by the tendency of the habitual words and acts.
It is true that there may be an outward correct¬ ness of deportment without the renewing power of Christ. The love of influence and the desire for the esteem of others may produce a well-ordered life. Self-respect may lead us to avoid the appearance of evil. A selfish heart may perform generous actions. Bv what means, then, shall we determine whose side
we are on? Whohastheheart?Withwhomareourthoughts?
Of whom do we love to converse? Who has our warmest affections arid our best energies? If we are Christ’s, our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts are of Him. All that we have and are is consecrated to Him. We long to bear His image, breathe His spirit, do His will, and please Him in all things.
Those who become new creatures in Christ Jesus will bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, “ love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

meekness, temperance.” 1 They will no longer fashion themselves according to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God they will follow in His steps, reflect His character, and purify themselves even as He is pure. The things they once hated, they now love; and the things they once loved, they hate. The proud and self-assertive become meek and lowly in heart. The vain and supercilious become serious and unobtrusive. The drunken become sober, and the profligate pure. The vain customs and fashions of the world are laid aside. Christians will seek not the “outward adorning,” but “the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the orna¬
ment of a meek and quiet spirit.” 2
There is no evidence of genuine repentance, unless
it works reformation. If he restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, confess his sins, and love God and his fellow men, the sinner may be sure that he has passed from death unto life.
When, as erring, sinful beings, we come to Christ and become partakers of His pardoning grace, love springs up in the heart. Every burden is light; for the yoke that Christ imposes is 1
easy. Duty becomes a delight,
and sacrifice a pleasure. The
path that before seemed shrouded

acter of Christ will be seen in His followers. It was His delight to do the will of God. Love to God, zeal for His glory, was the controlling power in our Saviour’s life. Love beautified and ennobled all His actions. Love is of God. The unconsecrated heart can not originate or produce it. It is found only in theheartwhereJesusreigns.“Welove,becauseHe first loved us.” 1 In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the principle of action.

love, cherished in the soul, sweetens the life, and sheds a refining influence on all around.
There are two errors against which the children of God— particularly those who have just come to trust in His grace— especially need to guard. The first, al¬
ready dwelt upon, is
that of looking to their own works, trusting to anything they can do, to bring themselves into har- 1t John 4:19, R. v,

mony with God. He who is trying to become holy by his own works in keeping the law, is attempting an impossibility. All that man can do without Christ is polluted with selfishness and sin. It is the grace of Christ alone, through faith, that can make us holy.
The opposite and no less dangerous error is, that belief in Christ releases men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone we become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing to do with our redemption.
But notice here that obedience is not a mere out ward compliance, but the service of love. The law of God is an expression of His very nature; it is an embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence is the foundation of His government in heaven and earth. If our hearts are renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul, will not the law of God be carried out in the life? When the principle of love is implanted in the heart, when man is renewed after the image of Him that created him,thenewcovenantpromiseisfulfilled,“Iwillput My laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.” 1 And if the law is written in the heart, will it not shape the life ? Obedience — the service and allegiance of love — is the true sign of disciple- ship. Thus the Scripture says, “ This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.” “He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His command¬ ments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.” 2 Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith
1Heb. 10:16. 2 1 John 5:3; 2: 4. 5

only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience.
We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is the free gift of God, to be received by faith.Butobedienceisthefruitoffaith.“Yeknow that He was manifested to take away our sins; and in Him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth
not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.”1 Here is the true test. If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in us, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions, will be in harmony with
the will of God as expressed in the precepts of His holy law. “ Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.” 2 Righteousness is defined by the stand¬ ard of God’s holy law, as expressed in the ten pre¬ cepts given on Sinai.
That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from the obligation of obedience to God, isnotfaith,butpresumption. “Bygraceareyesaved through faith.” But “ faith, if it hath not works, is dead.”3 Jesus said of Himself before He came to earth, “I delight to do Thy will, O My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.” 4 And just before He ascendedagaintoheavenHedeclared,“Ihavekept MyFather’scommandments,andabideinHislove.”5 The Scripture says, “Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. . . . He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so

to walk, even as He walked.” 1 “ Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should followHissteps.”2
The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been,— just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents,— perfect obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal life were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would be imperiled. The way would be open for sin, with all its train of woe and misery, to be immortalized.
It was possible for Adam, before the fall, to form a righteous character by obedience to God’s law. But he failed to do this, and because of his sin our natures are fallen, and we can not make ourselves righteous. Since we are sinful, unholy, we can not perfectly obey a holy law. We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet the claims of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of escape for us. He lived on earth amid trials and temptations such as we have to meet. He lived a sinless life. He died for us, and now He offers to take our sins and give us His righteousness. If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted right¬ eous. Christ’s character stands in place of your char¬ acter, and you are accepted before God just as if you
had not sinned.
More than this, Christ changes the heart. He

connection with Christ by faith and the continual sur¬ render of your will to Him; and so long as you do this, He will work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. So you may say, “The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.” 1 So Jesus said to His disciples, “ It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speak- eth in you.” 2 Then with Christ working in you, you will manifest the same spirit and do the same works,— works of righteousness, obedience.
So we have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by His Spirit working in and through us.
When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His word, are facts that even Satan and his hosts can not at heart deny. The Biblesaysthat“thedevilsalsobelieve,andtremble;”3 but this is not faith. Where there is not only a belief inGod’sWord,butasubmissionofthewilltoHim; where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections fixed upon Him, there is faith,— faith that works by love, and purifies the soul. Through this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God. And the heart that in its unrenewed state is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be, now delights in its holy pre-

cepts, exclaiming1 with the Psalmist, “ O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.” 1 And the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, “ who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” 2
There are those who have known the pardoning love of Christ, and who really desire to be children of God, yet they realize that their character is imper¬ fect, their life faulty, and they are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I would say, Do not draw back in despair. We shall often have to bow down and weep at the feet of Jesus because of our short-comings and mistakes; but we are not to be discouraged. Even if we are overcome by the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God. No; Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Said the beloved John, “ These things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” 3 And do not forget the words of Christ, “ The Father Himself loveth you.” 4 He desires to restore you to Himself, to see His own purity and holi¬ ness reflected in you. And if you will but yield your¬ self to Him, He that hath begun a good work in you will carry it forward to the day of Jesus Christ. Pray more fervently; believe more fully. As we come to distrust our own power, let us trust the power of our Redeemer, and we shall praise Him who is the health of our countenance.

The closer you come to Jesus, the more faulty you will appear in your own eyes; for your vision will be clearer, and your imperfections will be seen in
broad and distinct contrast to His perfect nature. .This is evidence that Satan’s delusions have lost their power; that f1e vivifying influence of the Spirit of God is arou: hy you.
No deep Ted love for Jesus can dwell in the heart that doe: not realize its own sinfulness. The soul that is transformed by the grace of Christ will admire His divine character; but if we do not see our own moral deformity, it is unmistakable evidence that we have not had a view of the beauty and excellence of Christ.
The less we see to esteem in ourselves, the more we shall see to esteem in the infinite purity and love¬ liness of our Saviour. A view of our sinfulness drives us to Him who can pardon; and when the soul,
realizing its helplessness, reaches out after Christ, He will reveal Himself in power. The more our sense of needdrivesustoHimandtotheWordofGod,the more exalted views we shall have of His character, and the more fully we shall reflect His image.

 Growing Up Into Christ
HE change of heart by which we become chil- J. dren of God is in the Bible spoken of as birth. Again, it is compared to the germination of the good seed sown by the husbandman. In like manner those who are just converted to Christ are, as “new-born babes,” to “ grow up ” 1 to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Or like the good seed sown in the field, they are to grow up and bring forth fruit.
Isaiah says that they shall “ be called trees of right¬ eousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.”2 So from natural life, illustrations are drawn, to help us better to understand the mysterious
truths of spiritual life.
Not all the wisdom and
skill of man can produce life in the smallest object in nature. It is only through |||§|f the life which God Himself

life from God that spiritual life is begotten in the hearts of men. Unless a man is “ born from above,” 3 he can not become a partaker of the life which Christ

As with life, so it is with growth. It is God who brings the bud to bloom and the flower to fruit. It is by His power that the seed develops, “ first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.” 1 And the prophet Hosea says of Israel, that “ he shall grow as the lily.” “ They shall revive as thecorn,andgrowasthevine.”2 AndJesusbids us “consider the lilies how they grow.” 3 The plants and flowers grow not by their own care or anxiety or effort, but by receiving that which God has furnished to minister to their life. The child can not, by any anxiety or power of its own, add to its stature. No more can you, by anxiety or effort of yourself, secure spiritual growth. The plant, the child, grows by receiving from its surroundings that which ministers toitslife,—air,sunshine,andfood.Whatthesegifts of nature are to animal and plant, such is Christ to those who trust in Him. He is their “everlasting light,” “a sun and shield.”4 He shall be as “the dew unto Israel.” “He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass.” 5 He is the living water, “ the bread of God . . . which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.” 6
In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the whole world with an atmosphere of grace, as real as the air which circulates around the globe. All who choose to breathe this life-giving atmosphere will live, and grow up to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.

In the same way as you received Him at first. “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him.” “The just shall live by faith.” 2 You gave yourself to God, to be His wholly, to serve and obey Him, and you took Christ as your Saviour. You could not yourself atone for your sins or change your heart; but having given yourself to God, you believedthatHeforChrist’ssakedidallthisforyou. By faith you became Christ’s, and by faith you are to grow up in Him,— by giving and taking. You are to give all,—- your heart, your will, your service,— give yourself to Him to obey all His requirements; andyoumusttakeall,—Christ,thefulnessofallbless¬ ing, to abide in your heart, to be your strength, your righteousness, your everlasting helper,— to give you power to obey.
Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, “ Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me to-day in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself
1Ps. 16: 8. 2Col. 2:6 ; Heb. io: 38.

 GROWING UP INTO CHRIST 75
to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ.
A life in Christ is a life of restfulness. There may be no ecstasy of feeling, but there should be an abid¬ ing, peaceful trust. Your hope is not in yourself; it is in Christ. Your weakness is united to His strength, your ignorance to Hi-s wisdom, your frailty to His enduring might. So you are not to look to yourself, not to let the mind dwell on self, but look
to Christ. Let the mind dwell upon His love, upon the beauty, the perfection, of His character. Christ in His self-denial, Christ in His humiliation, Christ in His purity and holiness, Christ in His matchless love, — this is the subject for the soul’s contempla¬
tion. It is bv loving Him, copying Him, depending wholly upon Him, that you are to be transformed into His likeness.
Jesus says, “ Abide in Me." These words convey the idea of rest, stability, v confidence. AgainHeinvites,“Comeunto Me, . . . and I will give you rest." 1 The words of the Psalmist express the same thought: “ Rest in the Lord, and wait pa¬ tiently for Him." And Isaiah gives the assurance, “ In quietness and in confi¬ dence shall be your strength." 2 This rest
is not found in inactivity; for in the

Saviour’s invitation the promise of rest is united with the call to labor: “ Take My yoke upon you, . . . and ye shall find rest.” 1 The heart that rests most fully upon Christ will be most earnest and active in labor for Him.
When the mind dwells upon self, it is turned away from Christ, the source of strength and life. Hence it is Satan’s constant effort to keep the attention di¬ verted from the Saviour, and thus prevent the union and communion of the soul with Christ. The pleas¬ ures of the world, life’s cares and perplexities and sorrows, the faults of others, or your own faults and imperfections,— to any or all of these he will seek to divert the mind. Do not be misled by his devices. Many who are really conscientious, and who desire to live for God, he too often leads to dwell upon their own faults and weaknesses, and thus by separating themfromChrist,hehopestogainthevictory.We should not make self the center, and indulge anxiety and fear as to whether we shall be saved. All this turns the soul away from the Source of our strength. Commit the keeping of your soul to God, and trust in Him. Talk and think of Jesus. Let self be lost in Him. Put away all doubt; dismiss your fears. Say
with the apostle Paul, “ I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.” 2 Rest in God. He is able to keep that which you have committed to Him. If you will leave yourself in His hands, He will bring 1Matt. 11:29. 2Gal. 2:20.

When Christ took human nature upon Him, He bound humanity to Himself by a tie of love that can never be broken by any power save the choice of man himself. Satan will constantly present allurements to induce us to break this tie,— to choose to separate ourselves from Christ. Here

Him, we “ are changed into the same
image from glory to glory, even as the house, at the table by the Spirit of the Lord.” 1
It was thus that the early disciples gained their likeness to the dear Saviour. When those disciples heard the words of Jesus, they felt their need of Him. They sought, they found, they followed Him. They were with Him in the house, at the table, in the closet, in the field. They were with Him as pupils with a teacher, daily receiving from His lips lessons of holy truth. They looked to Him, as servants to
12 Cor. 3: 18.
They were with Him in

STEPS TO CHRIST
their master, to learn their duty. Those disciples were men “subject to like passions as we are.”1 They had the same battle with sin to fight. They needed the same grace, in order to live a holy life.
Even John, the beloved disciple, the one who most fully reflected the likeness of the Saviour, did not naturally possess that loveliness of character. He was not only self-assertive and ambitious for honor, but impetuous and resentful under injuries. But as the character of the Divine One was manifested to him, he saw his own deficiency, and was humbled by
the knowledge. The strength and patience, the power and tenderness, the majesty and meekness, that he beheld in the daily life of the Son of God, filled his soul with admiration and love. Day by day his heart was drawn out toward Christ, until he lost sight of self in love for his Master. His resentful, ambitious temper was yielded to the molding power of Christ. The regenerating influence of the Holy Spirit renewed his heart. The power of the love of Christ wrought a transformation of character. This is the sure result ofunionwithJesus.WhenChristabidesintheheart, the whole nature is transformed. Christ’s Spirit, His
love, softens the heart, subdues the soul, and raises the thoughts and desires toward God and heaven.
When Christ ascended to heaven, the sense of His presence was still with His followers. It was a per¬ sonal presence, full of love and light. Jesus, the Saviour, who had walked and talked and prayed with them, who had spoken hope and comfort to their
hearts, had, while the message of peace was still upon 1James 5: 17.

 GROWING UP INTO CHRIST 79
His lips, been taken up from them into heaven, and the tones of His voice had come back to them, as the cloudofangelsreceivedHim,—Lo,Iamwithyou alway, even unto the end of the
world.” 1 He had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity. They knew that He was before the throne of God, their Friend and Saviour still; that His sympathies were unchanged; that Ide was still identified with suffering humanity. He was presenting before God the merits of His own precious blood, showing PIis
wounded hands and feet, in remem¬ brance of the price He had paid for
His redeemed. They knew that He had ascended to heaven to prepare
places for them, and that He would come again, and take them to Himself.
As they met together, after the ascension, they were eager to present their requests to the Father in the name of Jesus. In solemn awe they bowed in prayer,repeatingtheassurance,“Whatsoeveryeshall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you. HithertohaveyeaskednothinginMyname:ask,and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” 2 They extended the hand of faith higher and higher, with the mighty argument, “It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
of God, who also maketh intercession for us.” 3 And

Pentecost brought them the presence of the Comforter, of whom Christ had said, He “ shall be in you.” And He had further said, “ It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.” 1 Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in the hearts of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when He was per¬ sonally with them. The light, and love, and power of the indwelling Christ shone out through them, so that men,beholding,“marveled;andtheytookknowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.” 2
All that Christ was to the first disciples, He desires to be to His children to-day; for in that last prayer, with the little band of disciples gathered about Him, Hesaid,“NeitherprayIforthesealone,butforthem also which shall believe on Me through their word.” 3
Jesus prayed for us, and He asked that we might be one with Him, even as He is one with the Father. What a union is this! The Saviour has said of Him¬ self, “ The Son can do nothing of Himself; ” “ the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.” 4 Then if Christ is dwelling in our hearts, He will work in us “ both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” 5 WeshallworkasHeworked;weshallmanifestthe same spirit. And thus, loving Him and abiding in Him, we shall “ grow up into Him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.” 6

 The Work And The Life
Go d is the source of life and light and joy to the universe. Like rays of light from the sun, like the streams of water bursting from a living spring, blessings flow out from Him to all His creatures. And wherever the life of God is in the hearts of men, it will flow out to others in love and blessing.
OurSaviour’sjoywas’itheupliftingandredemp¬ tion of fallen men. For this He counted not His life dear unto Himself, but endured the cross, despising the shame. So angels are ever engaged in working for the happiness of others. This is their joy. That which selfish hearts would regard as humiliating serv¬
ice, ministering to those who are wretched and in every way inferior in character and rank, is
the work of sinless angels. The spirit of Christ’s self-sacrificing 4 love is the spirit that pervades heaven, and
is the very essence of
its bliss. This is the spirit that Christ’s followers will possess, the work that they will do.
Like streams of water bursting

 82
STEPS TO CHRIST
WhentheloveofChristisenshrinedintheheart, like sweet fragrance it can not be hidden. Its holy influence will be felt by all with whom we come in contact. The spirit of Christ in the heart is like a spring in the desert, flowing to refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish, eager to drink of the water of life.
Love to Jesus will be manifested in a desire to work as He worked, for the blessing and uplifting of humanity. It will lead to love, tenderness, and sym¬ pathytowardallthecreaturesofourheavenlyFather’s care.
The Saviour’s life on earth was not a life of ease and devotion to Himself, but He toiled with persistent, earnest, untiring effort for the salvation of lost man¬ kind. From the manger to Calvary He followed the path of self-denial, and sought not to be released from arduous tasks, painful travels, and exhausting care and labor. He said, “ The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.” 1 This was the one great object of His life. Everything else was secondary and sub¬ servient. It was His meat and drink to do the will of
God and to finish His work. Self and self-interest had no part in His labor.
So those who are the partakers of the grace of Christ will be ready to make any sacrifice, that others for whom He died may share the heavenly gift. They will do all they can to make the world better for their
stay in it. This spirit is the sure outgrowth of a soul 1Matt.2c:28.

 THE WORK AND THE LIFE 83
truly converted. No sooner does one come to Christ, than there is born in his heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth can not be shut up in his heart. If we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and are filled with the joy of His indwelling Spirit, we shall not be able to hold our peace. If we have tasted and seen that the Lord is good, we shall havesomethingtotell.LikePhilipwhenhefoundthe Saviour,weshallinviteothersintoHispresence.We shall seek to present to them the attractions of Christ,
and the unseen realities of the world to come. There will be an intensity of desire to follow in the path that Jesus trod. There will be an earnest longing that those around us may behold “ the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”
And the effort to bless others will react in blessings upon ourselves. This was the purpose of God in giv¬ ing us a part to act in the plan of redemption. He has granted men the privilege of becoming partakers of the divine nature, and, in their turn, of diffusing blessings to their fellow men. This is the highest honor, the greatest joy, that it is possible for God to bestow upon men. Those who thus become partici¬ pants in labors of love are brought nearest to their Creator.
God might have committed the message of the gospel, and all the work of loving ministry, to the heavenly angels. He might have employed other means for accomplishing His purpose. But in His

 84
STEPS TO CHRIST
infinite love He chose to make us co-workers with Himself, with Christ and the angels, that we might share the blessing, the joy, the spiritual uplifting, which results from this unselfish ministry.
WearebroughtintosympathywithChristthrough the fellowship of His sufferings. Every act of self- sacrifice for the good of others strengthens the spirit of beneficence in the giver’s heart, allying him more closely to the Redeemer of the world, who “ was rich, yet for your sakes became poor, that ye through His
poverty might be rich.” And it is only as we thus fulfil the divine purpose in our creation, that life can be a blessing to us.
If you will go to work as Christ designs that His disciples shall, and win souls for Him, you will feel the need of a deeper experience and a greater knowl¬ edge in divine things, and will hunger and thirst after righteousness. You will plead with God, and your faith will be strengthened, and your soul will drink deeper draughts at the well of salvation. Encountering opposition and trials will drive you to the Bible and to prayer. You will grow in grace and the knowledge of Christ, and will develop a rich experience.
The spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability, and Christlike loveliness to the character, and brings peace and happiness to its possessor. The aspirations are elevated. There is no room for sloth or selfishness. Those who thus exercise the Christian graces will grow and will become strong to work for God. They will have clear spiritual perceptions, a

steady, growing1 faith, and an increased power in prayer. The Spirit of God, moving upon their spirit, calls forth the sacred harmonies of the soul, in answer to the divine touch. Those who thus devote them¬ selves to unselfish effort for the good of others, are most surely working out their own salvation.
The only way to grow in grace is to be disinter¬ estedly doing the very work which Christ has enjoined upon us,—-to engage, to the extent of our ability, in helping and blessing those who need the help we can give them. Strength comes by exercise; activity is the very condition of life. Those who endeavor to maintainChristianlifebypassivelyacceptingthebless¬ ings that come through the means of grace, and doing nothing for Christ, are simply trying to live by eating without working. And in the spiritual as in the natu¬ ral world, this always results in degeneration and decay. A man who would refuse to exercise his limbs would soon lose all power to use them. Thus the Christian who will not exercise his God-given powers, not only fails to grow up into Christ, but he loses the strength that he already had.
The church of /Christ is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men. Its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. And the obligation rests upon all Christians. Every one, to the extent of his talent and opportunity, is to fulfil the Saviour’s commission.
The love of Christ, revealed to us, makes us debtors to all who know Him not. God has given us light, not for ourselves alone, but to shed upon them.

 86 STEPS TO CHRIST
If the followers of Christ were awake to duty, there would be thousands where there is one to-day, proclaiming the gospel in heathen lands. And all who could not personally engage in the work, would yet sustain it with their means, their sympathy, and their prayers. And there would be far more earnest labor for souls in Christian countries.
We need not go to heathen lands, or even leave the narrow circle of the home, if it is there that our duty lies, in order to work for Christ. We can do this in the home circle, in the church, among those with whom we associate, and with whom we do business.
The greater part of our Saviour’s life on earth was spentinpatienttoilinthecarpenter’sshopatNazareth. Ministering angels attended the Lord of life as He walked side by side with peasants and laborers, unrec¬ ognized and unhonored. He was as faithfully fulfill¬ ing His mission while working at His humble trade as when He healed the sick or walked upon the storm- tossed waves of Galilee. So, in the humblest duties and lowliest positions of life, we may walk and work with Jesus.
The apostle says, “ Let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.” 1 The business man may conduct his business in a way that will glorify his Master because of his fidelity. If he is a true fol¬ lower of Christ, he will carry his religion into every¬ thing that is done, and reveal to men the spirit of Christ. The mechanic may be a diligent and faithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks

 THE WORK AND THE LIFE 87
of life among the hills of Galilee. Every one who names the name of Christ should so work that others, by seeing his good works, may be led to glorify their Creator and Redeemer.
Many have excused themselves from rendering their gifts to the service of Christ because others were possessed of superior endowments and advantages. The opinion has prevailed that only those who are especially talented are required to consecrate their abilities to the service of God. It has come to be understood by many that talents are given to only a certain favored class, to the exclusion of others, who, of course, are not called upon to share in the toils or the rewards. But it is not so represented in the par¬ able. When the master of the house called his serv¬ ants, he gave to every man
his work. Withalovingspirit
we may perform life’s humblest duties “ as to
the Lord.” 1 If the love
of God is in the heart, it
will be manifested in the
life. The sweet savor of Christ will surround us, and our influence will elevate and bless.
You are not to wait for great occasions or to expect extraordinary abilities before you go to work for God.

 88 STEPS TO CHRIST
You need not have a thought of what the world will think of you. If your daily life is a testimony to the purity and sincerity of your faith, and others are convinced that you desire to benefit them, your efforts will not be wholly lost.
The humblest and poorest of the disciples of Jesus can be a blessing to others. They may not realize that they are doing any special good, but by thei-r uncon¬ scious influence they may start waves of blessing that will widen and deepen, and the blessed results they may never know until the day of final reward. They do not feel or know that they are doing anything great. They are not required to weary themselves with anxi¬ ety about success. They have only to go forward quietly, doing faithfully the work that God’s providence assigns, and their life will not be in vain. Their own souls will be growing more and more into the likeness of Christ; they are workers together with God in this life, and are thus fitting for the higher work and the unshadowed joy of the life to come.

 Our Saviour bound up His precious lessons with the things of nature
ANY are the ways in which God is seeking to make Himself known to us and to bring us into communion with Him. Nature
speaks to our senses without ceasing. The open heart will be impressed with the love and glory of God as revealed through the works of His hands. The listening ear can hear and understand the communications of God through the things of nature. The green fields, the lofty trees, the buds and flowers, the passing cloud, the falling rain, the bab¬ bling brook, the glories of the heavens, speak to our hearts, and invite us to

become acquainted with Him who made them all. Our Saviour bound up His precious lessons with the things of nature. The trees, the birds, the flowers of the valleys, the hills, the lakes, and the beautiful heavens, as well as the incidents and surroundings of daily life, were all linked with the words of truth, that His lessons might thus be often recalled to mind, even
amid the busv cares of man’s life of toil.

God would have His children appreciate His works, and delight in the simple, quiet beauty with which He has adorned our earthly home. He is a lover of the beautiful, and above all
that is outwardly attractive He loves beauty of character; He would have us cultivate purity and sim¬ plicity, the quiet graces of the flowers.

If vve would but fully believe this, all undue anxi¬ eties would be dismissed. Our lives would not be so filled with disappointment as now; for everything, whether great or small, would be left in the hands of God, who is not perplexed by the multiplicity of cares, or overwhelmed by their weight. We should then enjoy a rest of soul to which many have long been strangers.
As your senses delight in the attractive loveliness of the earth, think of the world that is to come, that shall never know the blight of sin and death; where the face of nature will no more wear the shadow of the curse. Let your imagination picture the home of the saved, and remember that it will be more glorious than your brightest imagination can portray. In the varied gifts of God in nature we see but the faintest gleaming of His glory. It is written, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.” 1
The poet and the naturalist have many things to say about nature, but it is the Christian who enjoys the beauty of the earth with the highest appreciation, because he recognizes his Father’s handiwork, and perceives His love in flower and shrub and tree. No one can fully appreciate the significance of hill and vale, river and sea, who does not look upon them as an expression of God’s love to man.

heart. In our circumstances and surroundings, in the changes daily taking place around us, we may find precious lessons, if our hearts are but open to discern them. The Psalmist, tracing the work of God’s provi¬ dence, says, “ The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.”1 “Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.” 2
God speaks to us in His Word. Here we have in clearer lines the revelation of His character, of His dealings with men, and the great work of redemption. Here is open before us the history of patriarchs and prophets and other holy men of old. They were men“subjecttolikepassionsasweare.”3 Wesee how they struggled through discouragements l.he our own, how they fell under temptation as we have done, and yet took heart again and conquered through the grace of God: and beholding, we are encouraged in our striving after righteousness. As we read of the precious experiences granted them, of the light and love and blessing it was theirs to enjoy, and of the work they wrought through the grace given them, the spirit that inspired them kindles a flame of holy emu¬ lation in our hearts, and a desire to be like them in character,— like them to walk with God.
Jesus said of the Old-Testament Scriptures,— and how much more is it true of the New,— “ They are they which testify of Me,”4 the Redeemer, Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. Yes, the whole Bible tells of Christ. From the first record
1Ps. 33:5-

93
of creation,—* for “ without Him was not anything made that was made,” 1— to the closing promise, “ Be¬ hold, I come quickly,” 2 we are reading of His works and listening to His voice. If you would become acquainted with the Saviour, study the Holy Scriptures.
Fill the whole heart with the words of God. They are the living water, quenching your burning thirst. They are the living bread from heaven. Jesus de¬ clares, “ Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.” And He explains Himself by saying, “ The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” 3 Our bodies are built up from what we eat and drink; and as in the natural economy, so in the spiritual economy: it is what we meditate upon that will give tone and strength to our spiritual nature.
The theme of redemption is one that the angels desire to look into; it will be the science and the song of the redeemed throughout th£ ceaseless ages of eternity. Is it not worthy of careful thought and study now? The infinite mercy and love of Jesus, the sacrifice made in our behalf, call for the most serious and solemn reflection. We should dwell upon the characterofourdearRedeemerandIntercessor.We should meditate upon the mission of Him who came to save His people from their sins. As we thus con¬ template heavenly themes, our faith and love will grow stronger, and our prayers will be more and more acceptable to God, because they will be more and more mixed with faith and love. They will be

intelligent and fervent. There will be more constant confidence in Jesus, and a daily, living experience in His power to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him.
As we meditate upon the perfections of the Saviour, we shall desire to be wholly transformed, and renewed in the image of His purity. There will be a hungering and thirsting of soul to become like Him whom we adore. The more our thoughts are upon Christ, the more we shall speak of Him to others, and represent Him to the world.
The Bible was not written for the scholar alone; on the contrary, it was designed for the common peo¬ ple. The great truths necessary for salvation are made as clear as noonday; and none will mistake and lose their way except those who follow their own judgment instead of the plainly revealed will of God.
We should not take the testimony of any man as to what the Scriptures teach, but should study the words of God for ourselves. If we allow others to do our thinking, we shall have crippled energies and contracted abilities. The noble powers of the mind may be so dwarfed by lack of exercise on themes worthy of their concentration as to lose their ability tograspthedeepmeaningoftheWordofGod.The mind will enlarge if it is employed in tracing out the relation of the subjects of the Bible, comparing scrip¬ ture with scripture, and spiritual things with spiritual.

But there is but little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the Scriptures. One may read the whole Bible through, and yet fail to see its beauty or com¬ prehend its deep and hidden meaning. One passage studied until its significance is clear to the mind, and its relation to the plan of salvation is evident, is of more value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite purpose in view and no positive instruc¬ tion gained. Keep your Bible with you. As you have opportunity, read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you are walking the streets, you may read a passage, and meditate upon it, thus fixing it in the mind.

Some portions of Scrip¬ ture are indeed too plain to be misunderstood; but there are others whose meaning does not lie on the surface, to be seen at a glance.

Never should the Bible be studied with¬ out prayer. Before opening its pages we should ask for the enlighten¬ ment of the Holy Spirit, and it willbegiven. WhenNathanael came to Jesus, the Saviour

The Holy Spirit exalts and glorifies the Saviour. It is His office to present Christ, the purity of His righteousness, and the great salvation that we have throughHim. Jesussays,“HeshallreceiveofMine, and shall show it unto you.” 2 The Spirit of truth is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. How must God esteem the human race, since He gave His Son
to die for them, and appoints His Spirit to be man’s teacher and continual guide.
1John i: 47, 48. 2John 16: 14

 The Privilege of Prayer
THROUGH nature and revelation, through His providence, and by the influence of His Spirit, God speaks to us. But these are not enough; we
need also to pour out our hearts to Him. In order to have spiritual life and energy, we must have actual intercourse with our heavenly Father. Our minds may be drawn out toward Him; we may meditate upon His works, Flis mercies, His blessings; but this is not, in the fullest sense, communing with Him. In order to commune with God, we must have something to say to Him concerning our actual life.
Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it is necessary, in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable us
to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to Him.
When Jesus was upon the earth, He taught His disciples how to pray. He directed them to present their daily needs before God, and to cast all their care upon Him. And the assurance He gave them that their petitions should be heard, is assurance also to us.
Jesus Himself, while He dwelt among men, was often in prayer. Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weakness, in that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father fresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth braced for duty and trial. He is our example in all things.

He is a brother in our infirmities, “in all points tempted like as we are; ” but as the sinless one, His nature recoiled from evil; He endured struggles and torture of soul in a world of sin. His humanity made prayer a necessity and a privilege. He found com¬ fort and joy in communion with His Father. And if the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of fervent, constant prayer.
Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fulness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of ooundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray jo little! God is ready and
willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much manifest reluc¬ tance on our part to make known our wants to God.
What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God’s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little, and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem sat¬ isfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence.
The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray. The whispered tempftitions of the enemy entice them to sin; and it is all because they

do not make use of the privileges that God has given theminthedivineappointmentofprayer. Whyshould the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where are treasured the bound¬ less resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy-seat, that we may not by earnest suppli¬ cation and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation.
There are certain conditions upon which we may expect that God will hear and answer our prayers. One of the first of these is that we feel our need of help from Him. He has promised, “I will pour water upon him that 'is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.” 1 Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, who long after God, may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must be open to the Spirit’s influence, or God’s blessing can not be received.
Our great need is itself an argument, and pleads most eloquently in our behalf. But the Lord is to be sought unto to do these things for us. He says, “Ask, and it shall be given you.” And “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things ? ” 2
If we regard iniquity in our hearts, if we cling to any known sin, the Lord will not hear us ; but the
1Isa. 44:3. 2Matt. 7:7; Rom. 8:32.

 IOO STEPS TO CHRIST
prayer of the penitent, contrite soul is always accepted. When all known wrongs are righted, we may believe that God will answer our petitions. Our own merit will never commend us to the favor of God; it is the worthiness of Jesus that will save us, His blood that will cleanse us; yet we have a work to do in com¬ plying with the conditions of acceptance.
Another element of prevailing prayer is faith. “He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”1 JesussaidtoHisdisciples,“Whatthings soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” 2 Do we take Him at His word?
The assurance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has promised. When we do not receive the very things we ask for, at the time we ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears, and that He will answer our prayers. We are so erring and shortsighted that we sometimes ask for things that would not be a blessing to us, and our heavenly Father in love answers our prayers by giving us that which will be for our highest good,— that which we
ourselves would desire if with vision divinely enlight¬ enedwecouldseeallthingsastheyreallyare.When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will always be answered in
die very way and for the particular thing that we 1Heb- ii: 6 2Mark 11:24.

 THE PRIVILEGE OF PRAYER IOI
desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. Then do not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate answer to your prayers. Rely upon His sure promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you.” 1
If we take counsel with our doubts and fears, or try to solve everything that we can not see clearly, before we have faith, perplexities will only increase and deepen. But if we come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as we really are, and in humble, trust¬ ing faith make known our wants to Him whose knowl¬ edge is infinite, who sees everything in creation, and who governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend to our cry, and will let light shine into our hearts. Through sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite. We mav have no remarkable evidence at the time that , the face of our Redeemer is bending over us in com¬ passion and love; but this is even so. We may not
feel His visible touch, but His hand is upon us in love and pitying tenderness.
When we come to ask mercy and blessing from God, we should have a spirit of love and forgiveness in our own hearts. How can we pray, “ Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,” 2 and yet indulge an unforgiving spirit? If we expect our own prayers, to be heard, we must forgive others in the same man¬ ner, and to the same extent, as we hope to be forgiven.
Perseverance in prayer has been made a condition 1Matt.7:7. 2Matt.6:12.

of receiving. We must pray always, if we would growinfaithandexperience.Wearetobe“instant in prayer,” to “ continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.”1 Peter exhorts believers to be “ sober, and watch unto prayer.” 2 Paul directs, “ In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.”3 “Butye,beloved,”saysJude,“prayingin the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God.” 4 Unceasing prayer is the unbroken union of the soul with God, so that life from God flows into our life; and from our life, purity and holiness flow back to God.
There is necessity for diligence in prayer; let noth¬ ing hinder you. Make every effort to keep open the communion between Jesus and your own soul. Seek every opportunity to go where prayer is wont to be
made. Those who are really seeking for communion with God, will be seen in the prayer-meeting, faithful to do their duty, and earnest and anxious to reap all the benefits they can gain. They will improve every opportunity of placing themselves where they can receive the rays of light from heaven.
We should pray in the family circle; and above all we must not neglect secret prayer; for this is the life of the soul. It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is neglected. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. In solitude let the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of God. Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No

curious ear is to receive the burden ot such petitions. In secret prayer the soul is free from surrounding in¬ fluences, free from excitement. Calmly, yet fervently, will it reach out after God. Sweet and abiding will be the influence emanating from Him who seeth in secret, whose ear is open to hear the prayer arising from the heart. By calm, simple faith, the soul holds com¬ munion with God, and gathers to itself rays of divine light to strengthen and sustain it in the conflict with Satan. God is our tower of strength.

den Him; you can not weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children. “The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” 1 His heart of love is touched by our sorrows, and even by our utterance of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him to unravel. No calamity, can befall the least of His children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is unobservant, or in which He takes no immediate interest. “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” 2 The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son.

God does not mean that any of us should become hermits or monks, and retire from the world, in order to devote ourselves to acts of worship. The life must be like Christ’s life,— between the mountain and the multitude. He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his prayers will become a formal rou¬ tine. When men take themselves out of social life, away from the sphere of Christian duty and cross¬ bearing; when they cease to work earnestly for the
Master, who worked earnestly for them, they lose the subject-matter of prayer, and have no incentive to devotion. Their prayers become personal and selfish. They can not pray in regard to the wants of humanity or the upbuilding of Christ’s kingdom, pleading for strength wherewith to work.

The proper cultivation of the social elements in our nature brings us into sympathy with others, and is a means of development and strength to us in the service of God.
If Christians would associate together, speaking to each other of the love of God, and of the precious

truths of redemption, their own hearts would be re¬ freshed, and they would refresh one anothc:*. We may be daily learning' more of our heavenly Father, gaining a fresh experience of His grace; 4hen we shall desire to speak of His love; and as we do his, our own hearts will be warmed and encouraged. If we thought and talked more of Jesus, and less of self, we should have far more of His presence.
If we would but think of God as often as we have evidence of His care for us, we should keep Him ever in our thoughts, and should delight to talk of Him and to praise Him. We talk of temporal things because we have an interest in them. We talk of our friends because we love them; our joys and our sor¬ rows are bound up with them. Yet we have infinitely greater reason to love God than to love our earthly friends; and it should be the most natural thing in the world to make Him first in all our thoughts, to talk of His goodness and tell of His power. The rich gifts He has bestowed upon us were not intended to absorb our thoughts and love so much that we should have nothing to give to God; they are con¬ stantly to remind us of Him, and to bind us in bonds ofloveandgratitudetoourheavenlyBenefactor.We dwell too near the lowlands of earth. Let us raise our eyes to the open door of the sanctuary above, where the light of the glory of God shines in the face of Christ, who “ is able also to save them to the utter¬ most that come unto God by Him.” 1

Anciently the Lord bade Israel, when they met together for His service, “Ye shall eat before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.” 2 That which is done for the glory of God should be done with cheerfulness, with songs of praise and thanksgiving, not with sadness and gloom.
Our God is a tender, merciful Father. His service should not be looked upon as a heart-saddening, dis¬ tressing exercise. It should be a pleasure to worship
the Lord and to take part in His work. God would not have His children, for whom so great salvation has been provided, act as if He were a hard, exacting taskmaster. He is their best friend; and when they worship Him, He expects to be with them, to bless and comfort them, filling their hearts with joy and love. The Lord desires His children to take comfort in His service, and to find more pleasure than hard¬ ship in His work. He desires that those who come to worship Him shall carry away with them precious thoughts of His care and love, that they may be cheered

 What To Do With Doubt
MA N Y , especially those who are young in the Christian life, are at times troubled with the suggestions of skepticism. There are in the Bible many things which they can not explain, or even understand, and Satan employs these to shake their faith in the Scriptures as a revelation from God. They ask, “ How shall I know the right way? If the Bible isindeedtheWordofGod,howcanIbefreedfrom these doubts and perplexities ? ”
God never asks us to believe, without giving suffi¬ cient evidence upon which to base our faith. His existence,Hischaracter,thetruthfulnessofHisWord, are all established by testimony that appeals to our reason; and this testimony is abundant. Yet God has never removed the possibility of doubt. Our faith must rest upon evidence, not demonstration. Those who wish to doubt will have opportunity; while those who really desire to know the truth, will find plenty of evidence on which to rest their faith.
It is impossible for finite minds fully to compre¬ hend the character or the works of the Infinite One. To the keenest intellect, the most highly educated mind, that holy Being must ever remain clothed in mystery. “ Canst thou by searching find out God ? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do ? deeper than hell; what canst thou know ?” 1
1Job 11:7,8.

 WHAT TO DO WITH DOUBT 111
The apostle Paul exclaims, “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! ” 1 But though “ clouds and dark¬ ness are round about Him,” “righteousness and judg¬ mentarethefoundationofHisthrone.”2 Wecan so far comprehend His dealing with us, and the motives by which He is actuated, that we may discern bound¬ less love and mercy United to infinite power. We can understand as much of His purposes as it is for our good to know; and beyond this we must still trust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.
TheWordofGod,likethecharacterofitsdivine Author, presents mysteries that can never be fully comprehended by finite beings. The entrance of sin into the world, the incarnation of Christ, regeneration, the resurrection, and many other subjects presented in the Bible, are mysteries too deep for the human mind to explain, or even fully to comprehend. But we havenoreasontodoubtGod’sWordbecausewecan not understand the mysteries of His providence. In the natural world we are constantly surrounded with mysteries that we can not fathom. The very humblest forms of life present a problem that the wisest of philosophers is powerless to explain. Everywhere are wonders beyond our ken. Should we then be sur¬ prised to find that in the spiritual world also there are mysteries that we can not fathom? The difficulty lies solely in the weakness and narrowness of the human
mind. God has given us in the Scriptures sufficient 1Rom. 11:33. 2Ps. 97:2, R. V.

 I12 STEPS TO CHRIST
evidence of their divine character, and we are not to doubt His Word because we can not understand all the mysteries of His providence.
The apostle Peter says that there are in Scripture “ things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest . . . unto- their own destruction.” 1 The difficulties of Scripture have been urged by skeptics as an argument against the Bible; but so far from this, they constitute a strong evidence of its divine inspiration. If it contained no account of God but that which we could easily comprehend; if His greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds, then the Bible would not bear the unmis¬ takable credentials of divine authority. The very grandeur and mystery of the themes presented, should inspirefaithinitastheWordofGod.
The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and a per¬ fect adaptation to the needs and longings of the human heart, that has astonished and charmed the most highly cultivated minds, while it enables the humble and uncul¬ tured to discern the way of salvation. And yet these simply stated truths lay hold upon subjects so ele¬ vated, so far-reaching, so infinitely beyond the power of human comprehension, that we can accept them only because God has declared them. Thus the plan of redemption is laid open to us, so that every soul may see the steps he is to take in repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ, in order to be saved in God’s appointed way; yet beneath these truths, so easily understood, lie mysteries that are the

 WHAT TO DO WITH DOUBT

hiding of His glory,— mysteries that overpower the mind in its research, yet inspire the sincere seeker for truth with reverence and faith. The more he searches the Bible, the deeper is his conviction that it is the word of the living God, and human reason bows before the majesty of divine revelation.
To acknowledge that we can not fully comprehend the great truths of the Bible is only to admit that the finite mind is inadequate to grasp the infinite; that man, with his limited, human knowledge, can not understand the purposes of Omniscience.
Because they can not fathom all its mysteries, the skepticandtheinfidelrejectGod’sWord;andnotall who profess to believe the Bible are free from danger on this point. The apostle says, “ Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.” 1 It is right to study closely the teachings of the Bible, and to search into “ the deep things of God,” 2 so far as they are revealedinScripture.While“thesecretthingsbelong unto the Lord our God,” “those things which ^re revealed belong unto us.” 3 But it is Satan’s work to pervert the investigative powers of the mind. A cer¬ tain pride is mingled with the consideration of Bible truth, so that men reel impatient and defeated if they cannot.explaineveryportionofScripturetotheirsat¬ isfaction. It is too humiliating to them to acknowledge that they do not understand the inspired words. They are unwilling to wait patiently until God shall see fit to reveal the truth to them. They feel that their

unaided human wisdom is sufficient to enable them to comprehend the Scripture, and failing to do this, they virtually deny its authority. It is true that many theories and doctrines popularly supposed to be derived from the Bible have no foundation in its teaching, and indeed are contrary to the whole tenor of inspira¬ tion, These things have been a cause of doubt and perplexity to many minds. They are not, however, chargeable to God’s Word, but to man’s perversion
of it.
If it were possible for created beings to attain to a
full understanding of God and His works, then, having reached this point, there would be for them no further discovery of truth, no growth in knowledge, no fur¬ ther development of mind or heart. God would no longer be supreme; and man, having reached the limit of knowledge and attainment, would cease to advance. Let us thank God that it is not so. God is infinite; in Him are “all the treasures of wisdom and knowl¬ edge.” 1 And to all eternity men may be ever search¬ ing, ever learning, and yet never exhaust the treasures
of His wisdom, His goodness, and His power.

God desires man to exercise his reasoning powers; and the study of the Bible will strengthen and elevate the mind as no other study can. Yet we are to beware of deifying reason, which is subject to the weakness and infirmity of humanity. If we would not have the Scriptures clouded to our understanding, so that the plainest truths shall not be comprehended, we must have the simplicity and faith of a little child, ready to learn, and beseeching the aid of the Holy Spirit. A sense of the power and wisdom of God, and of our inability to comprehend His greatness, should inspire us with humility, and we should open His Word, as we would enter His presence, with holy awe. When we come to the Bible, reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself, and heart and intellect must bow to the great I AM.

But with¬ out the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we shall be con¬ tinuallyliabletowresttheScripturesortomisinterpret them.

the mind is clouded with doubt; and in the very study of the Bible, skepticism strengthens. The enemy takes control of the thoughts, and he suggests interpretations thatarenotcorrect.Whenevermenarenotinword and deed seeking to be in harmony with God, then, however learned they may be, they are liable to err in their understanding of Scripture, and it is not safe to trust to their explanations. Those who look to the Scriptures to find discrepancies, have not spiritual in¬ sight. Withdistortedvisiontheywillseemanycauses for doubt and unbelief in things that are really plain and simple.
Disguise it as they may, the real cause of doubt and skepticism, in most cases, is the love of sin. The teachingsandrestrictionsofGod’sWordarenotwel¬ come to the proud, sin-loving heart, and those who are unwilling to obey its requirements are ready to doubt its authority. In order to arrive at truth, we must have a sincere desire to know the truth, and a willingness of heart to obey it. And all who come in this spirit to the study of the Bible, will find abundant evidence that it is God’s Word, and they may gain an understanding of its truths that will make them wise unto salvation.
Christ has said, “If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching.”1 Instead of questioning and caviling concerning that which you do not understand, give heed to the light that already shines upon you, and you will receive greater light. By the grace of Christ, perform every duty that has
1John 7:17, R. V.

 WHAT TO DO WITH DOUBT II J
been made plain to your understanding, and you will be enabled to understand and perform those of which you are now in doubt.
There is an evidence that is open to all,— the most highly educated, and the most illiterate,— the evidence of experience. God invites us to prove for ourselves the reality of His Word, the truth of His promises. He bids us “ taste and see that the Lord is good.” 1 Instead of depending upon the word of another, we are to taste for ourselves. He declares, “Ask, and ye shall receive.” 2 His promises will be fulfilled. They have never failed; they never can fail. And as we draw near to Jesus, and rejoice in the fulness of His love, our doubt and darkness will disappear in the light of His presence.
The apostle Paul says that God “ hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us intothekingdomofHisdearSon.”3 Andeveryone who has passed from death unto life is able to “ set to his seal that God is true.” 4 He can testify, “ I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; and now the Bible is to me the revelation of Jesus Christ. Do you ask why I believe in Jesus?—because He is to me a divine Saviour. Why do I believe the Bible? — Because I have found it to be the voice of God to mysoul.”Wemayhavethewitnessinourselvesthat the Bible is true, that Christ is the Son of God. We know that we are not following cunningly devised fables.

Peter exhorts his brethren to “ grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”1 WhenthepeopleofGodaregrowingin grace, they will be constantly obtaining a clearer un¬ derstandingofHisWord.Theywilldiscernnewlight and beauty in its sacred truths. This has been true in the history of the church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the end. “ The path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” 2
By faith we may look to the hereafter, and grasp the pledge of God for a growth of intellect, the human faculties uniting with the divine, and every power of the soul being brought into direct contact with the Source of light. We may rejoice that all which has perplexed us in the providences of God will then be made plain ; things hard to be understood will then find an explanation; and where our finite minds dis¬ covered only confusion and broken purposes, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. “ Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.” 3

 Rejoicing In The Lord
THE children of God are called to be representa¬ tives of Christ, showing forth the goodness and mercy of the Lord. As Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know His tender, pitying love. “As Thou hast sent Me into the world,” said Jesus,“evensohaveIalsosentthemintotheworld.”
“ I in them, and Thou in Me, . . . that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me.” 1 The apostle Paul saystothedisciplesofJesus,“Yearemanifestlyde¬
claredtobetheepistleofChrist,”“knownandreadof all men.” 2 In every one of His children, Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ’s follower, He sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with Him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may’ be that through you they will be led to understand something of His goodness, and be won to love and serve Him.

STEPS TO CHRIST
Christians are set as light bearers on the way to heaven
get a right conception of Christ and of His service.
If we do represent Christ, we shall make His service appear attrac¬ tive, as it really is. Christians who gather up gloom, and sadness to their souls, and murmur and complain, are giving to others a false representation of God and the Christian life. They give the impression that God is not pleased to have His children happy, and in this they bear false witness against our heavenly
Father.
Satan is exultant when he can lead
the children of God into unbelief and despondency. He delights to see us mis¬ trusting God, doubting His willingness
and power to save us. He loves to have us feel that the Lord will do us harm by His providences. It is the work of Satan to represent the Lord as lacking in com¬
passion and pity. He misstates the truth in regard to Him. He fills the imagination with false ideas concerning God; and instead of dwelling upon the truth in regard to our heavenly Father, we too often fix our minds upon the misrepresentations of Satan, and dishonor God by distrusting Him and mur¬
muring against Him. Satan ever seeks to make the religious life one of gloom. He desires it to appear toilsome and difficult; and when the Christian presents

 REJOICING IN THE LORD I2 I
in his own life this view of religion, he is, through his unbelief, seconding the falsehood of Satan.
Many, walking along the path of life, dwell upon their mistakes and failures and disappointments, and their hearts are filled with grief and discouragement. While I was in Europe, a sister who had been doing this, and who was in deep distress, wrote
to me, asking for some word of en¬
couragement. The night after I had
read her letter, I dreamed that I
was in a garden, and one who seemed to be the owner of the gar¬
den was conducting me through its paths. I was gathering the flowers
and enjoying their fragrance, when
this sister, who had been walking
by my side, called my attention
to some unsightly briers that were impeding her way. There she was, mourning and grieving. She was not walking in the pathway, following the
guide, but was walking among the briers and thorns. “ O,” she mourned, “ is it not a pity that this beautiful garden is spoiled with thorns ? ” Then the guide said, “ Let the thorns alone, for they will only wound you.
Gather the roses, the lilies, and the pinks.”
Have there not been some bright spots in your experience? Have you not had some precious sea¬ sons when your heart throbbed with joy in response to the Spirit of God? When you look back into the

 122 STEPS TO CHRIST
chapters of your life-experience, do you not find some pleasant pages? Are not God’s promises, like the fragrant flowers, growing beside your path on every hand? Will you not let their beauty and sweetness fill your heart with joy?
The briers and thorns will only wound and grieve you ; and if you gather only these things, and present them to others, are you not, besides slighting the goodness of God yourself, preventing those around you
from walking in the path of life?
It is not wise to gather together all the unpleasant
recollections of a past life,— its iniquities and disap¬ pointments,— to talk over them and mourn over them until we are overwhelmed with discouragement. A
O, is it not a pity that this beautiful garden is spoiled with thorns?
discouraged soul is filled with dark¬ ness, shutting out the light of God from his own soul, and casting a shadow upon the pathway of others.
Thank God for the bright pic¬ tures which He has presented to us. Let us group together the blessed
assurances df His love, that we may look upon them continually.. The Son of God leaving His Father’s throne,
clothing His divinity with humanity, that He might rescue man from the power of Satan; His triumph in our behalf, opening heaven to men, reveal¬
ing to human vision the presence cham¬ ber where the Deity unveils His glory;

fallen race uplifted from the pit of ruin into which sin had plunged it, and brought again into connec¬
tion with the infinite God, and

 124
STEPS TO CHRIST
“ The Lord does not mean this for me. Perhaps He loves others, but He does not love me.”
All this is harming your own soul; for every word of doubt you utter is inviting Satan’s temptations; it is strengthening in you the tendency to doubt, and it is grieving from you the ministering angels. When Satan tempts you, breathe not a word of doubt or darkness. If you choose to open the door to.his sug¬ gestions, your mind will be filled with distrust and rebellious questioning. If you talk out your feelings, every doubt you express not only reacts upon your¬ self, but it is a seed that will germinate and bear fruit in the life of others, and it may be impossible to coun¬ teract the influence of your words. You yourself may be able to recover from the season of temptation and from the snare of Satan, but others, who have been swayed by your influence, may not be able to escape from the unbelief you have suggested. How impor¬ tant that we speak only those things that will give spiritual strength and life!
Angels are listening to hear what kind of report you are bearing to the world about your heavenly Master. Let your conversation be of Him who liveth to make intercession for you before the Father. When you take the hand of a friend, let praise to God be on your lips and in your heart. This will attract his thoughts to Jesus.
All have trials; griefs hard to bear, temptations hard to resist. Do not tell your troubles to your fel¬ low mortals, but carry everything to God in prayer.

 REJOICING IN THE LORD
I25
Make it a rule never to utter one word of doubt or discouragement. You can do much to brighten the life of others and strengthen their efforts, by words of hope and holy cheer.
There is many a brave soul sorely pressed by temp¬ tation, almost ready to faint in the conflict with self and with the powers of evil. Do not discourage such a one in his hard struggle. Cheer him with brave, hopeful words that shall urge him on his way. Thus the light of Christ may shine from you. “None of us liveth to himself.” 1 By our unconscious influence others may be encouraged and strengthened, or they may be discouraged, and repelled from Christ and the truth.
There are many who have an erroneous idea of the life and character of Christ. They think that He was devoid of warmth and sunniness, that He was stern, severe, and joyless. In many cases the whole religious experience is colored by these gloomy views.
It is often said that Jesus wept, but that He was never known to smile. Our Saviour was indeed a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, for He opened His heart to all the woes of men. But though His. life was self-denying and shadowed with pain and care, His spirit was not crushed. His countenance did not wear an expression of grief and repining, but ever one of peaceful serenity. His heart was a well- spring of life; and wherever He went, He carried rest and peace, joy and gladness.
Our Saviour was deeply serious and intensely in 1Rom.14:7.

 126 STEPS TO CHRIST
earnest, but never gloomy or morose. The life of those who imitate Him will be full of earnest pur¬ pose ; they will have a deep sense of personal respon¬ sibility. Levity will be repressed; there will be no boisterous merriment, no rude jesting; but the relig¬ ion of Jesus gives peace like a river. It does not quench the light of joy; it does not restrain cheer¬ fulness, nor cloud the sunny, smiling face.' Christ came not to be ministered unto, but to minister; and when His love reigns in the heart, we shall follow His example.
If we keep uppermost in our minds the unkind and unjust acts of others, we shall find it impossible to love them as Christ has loved us; but if our thoughts dwell upon the wondrous love and pity of Christ for us,thesamespiritwillflowouttoothers.Weshould love and respect one another, notwithstanding the faults and imperfections that we can not help seeing. Hu¬ mility and self-distrust should be cultivated, and a patient tenderness with the faults of others. This will kill out all narrowing selfishness, and make us large- hearted and generous.
The Psalmist says, ‘‘Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.”1 “Trust in the Lord.” Each day has its burdens, its cares and perplexities; and when we meet, how ready we are to talk of our difficulties and trials. So many borrowed troubles intrude, so many fears are indulged, such a weight of anxiety is ex¬ pressed, that one might suppose we had no pitying,
1Ps„ 37: 3.

 REJOICING IN THE LORD 127
loving Saviour, ready to hear all our requests, and to be to us a present help in every time of need.
Some are always fearing, and borrowing trouble. Every day they are surrounded with the tokens of God's love; every day they are enjoying the bounties of His providence; but they overlook these present blessings. Their minds are continually dwelling upon something disagreeable, which they fear may come; or some difficulty may really exist, which, though small, blinds their eyes to the many things that demand gratitude. The difficulties they encounter, instead of driving them to God, the only source of their help, separate them from Him, because they awaken unrest and repining.
Do we well to be thus unbelieving? Why should we be ungrateful and distrustful? Jesus is our friend; all Heaven is interested in our welfare. We should not allow the perplexities and worries of every-day life to fret the mind and cloud the brow. If we do, we shall always have something to vex and annoy. We should not indulge a solicitude that only frets and wears us, but does not help us to bear trials.
You may be perplexed in business; your prospects may grow darker and darker, and you may be threat¬ ened with loss; but do not become discouraged; cast your care upon God, and remain calm and cheerful. Pray for wisdom to manage your affairs with discre¬ tion, and thus prevent loss and disaster. Do all you can on your part to bring about favorable results. Jesus has promised His aid, but not apart from our

 128 STEPS TO CHRIST
effort. When, relying upon our Helper, you have done all you can, accept the result cheerfully.
It is not the will of God that His people should be weighed down with care. But our Lord does not deceive us. He does not say to us, “Do not fear; there are no dangers in your path.” He knows there are trials and dangers, and He deals with us plainly. He does not propose to take His people out of a world of sin and evil, but He points them to a never-failing refuge. His prayer for His disciples was, “I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” “ In the world,” He says, “ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” 1
In His sermon on the mount, Christ taught His disciples precious lessons in regard to the necessity of trusting in God. These lessons were designed to en¬ courage the children of God through all ages, and they have come down to our time full of instruction and comfort. The Saviour pointed His followers to the birds of the air as they warbled their carols of praise, unencumbered with thoughts of care, for “theysownot,neitherdotheyreap.”Andyetthe great Father provides for their needs. The Saviour asks, “Are ye not much better than they?”2 The great Provider for man and beast opens His hand and supplies all His creatures. The birds of the air are not beneath His notice. He does not drop the food into their bills, but He makes provision for their needs. They must gather the grains He has scattered for
1John 17:15; 16:33. 2Matt. 6:26.

 REJOICING IN THE LORD
129
them. They must prepare the material for their little nests. They must feed their young. They go forth singing to their labor, for “your heavenly Father feedeth them.” And “are ye not much better than they?” Are not you, as intelligent, spiritual wor¬
shipers, of more value than the birdsoftheair?Willnotthe Authorofourbeing,thePre¬ server of our life, the One
who formed us in Plis own divine image, provide for
our necessities if we but > trust in Him?
Christ pointed His dis¬
ciples to the flowers of the
field, growing in rich profusion, and glowing in the simple beauty which the heavenly Father had given them, as an expression of His love to man. He said, “ Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.” The
beauty and simplicity of these natural flowers far out¬ rival the splendor of Solomon. The most gorgeous attire produced by the skill of art can not bear com¬ parison with the natural grace and radiant beauty of the flowers of God’s creation. Jesus asks, “ If God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much moreclotheyou,Oyeoflittlefaith?”1 IfGod,the divine artist, gives to the simple flowers that perish in a day their delicate and varied colors, how much greater care will He have for those who are created
Matt.6:28,30. •

They must feed their young

 130 STEPS TO CHRIST
in His own image ? This lesson of Christ’s is a rebuke to the anxious thought, the perplexity and doubt, of the faithless heart.
The Lord would have all His sons and daughters happy, peaceful, and obedient. Jesus says, “My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” “ These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joymightbefull.”1
Happiness that is sought from selfish motives, out¬ side of the path of duty, is ill-balanced, fitful, and transitory; it passes away, and the soul is filled with lonelinessandsorrow;butthereisjoyandsatisfaction in the service of God; the Christian is not left to walk in uncertain paths ; he is not left to vain regrets and disappointments. If we do not have the pleasures of this life, we may still be joyful in looking to the life
beyond.
But even here Christians may have the joy of com¬
munion with Christ; they may have the light of His love, the perpetual comfort of His presence. Every step in life may bring us closer to Jesus, may give us a deeper experience of His love, and may bring us one step nearer to the blessed home of peace. Then let us not cast away our confidence, but have firm assurance, firmer than ever before. “Hitherto hath the Lord helpedus,”2andHewillhelpustotheend.Letus look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the 1John14:27;15:11. 21Sam.7:12.

 REJOICING IN THE LORD 131
hand of the destroyer. Let us keep fresh in our mem¬ ory all the tender mercies that God has shown us,—- the tears He has wiped away, the pains He has soothed, the anxieties removed, the fears dispelled, the wants supplied, the blessings bestowed,— thus strengthening ourselves for all that is before us through
the remainder of our pilgrimage.
We can not but look forward to new perplexities
in the coming conflict, but we may look on what is past as well as on what is to come, and say, “ Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.” “As thy days, so shall thy strength be.” 1 The trial will not exceed the strength that shall be given us to bear it. Then let us take up our work just where we find it, believing that what¬ ever may come, strength proportionate to the trial
.will be given.
And by and by the gates of heaven will be thrown
open to admit God’s children, and from the lips of the King of glory the benediction will fall on their ears like richest music, “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” 2
Then the redeemed will be welcomed to the home that Jesus is preparing for them. There their com¬ panions will not be the vile of earth, liars, idolaters, the impure, and unbelieving; but they will associate with those who have overcome Satan, and through divine grace have formed perfect characters. Every sinful tendency, every imperfection, that afflicts them here, has been removed by the blood of Christ, and
1Deut. 33:25. 2Matt. 25:34.
/

 l3 2
STEPS TO CHRIST
the excellence and brightness of His glory, far exceed¬ ing the brightness of the sun, is imparted to them. And the moral beauty, the perfection of His character, shines through them, in worth far exceeding this out¬ ward splendor. They are without fault before the great white throne, sharing the dignity and the privi¬ leges of the angels.
In view of the glorious inheritance that may be his, “what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?” 1 He may be poor, yet he possesses in himself a wealth and dignity that the world could never bestow. The soul redeemed and cleansed from sin, with all its noble powers dedicated to the service of God, is of surpassing worth; and there is joy in heaven in the presence of God and the holy angels over one soul redeemed, a joy that is expressed in songs of holy triumph.
1Matt. 16:26.
There is joy in heaven over one soul redeemed
